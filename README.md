# Machine-Learning-Algorithms


* Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows software applications 
to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. 

* Machine Learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.


### Common Use Cases of Machine Learning :
```
Recommendation Engines
Fraud Detection
Predictive maintenance.
```

#### Types of Machine Learning :
* Supervised Learning : Uses Labeled input and output the data.
* Unsupervised Learning : used to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets.
* Semi-supervised Learning
