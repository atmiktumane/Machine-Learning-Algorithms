# Machine-Learning-Algorithms


* Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows software applications 
to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. 

* Machine Learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.
