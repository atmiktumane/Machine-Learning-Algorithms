# Machine-Learning-Algorithms


* Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows software applications 
to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. 

* Machine Learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.


### Common Use Cases of Machine Learning :
```
Recommendation Engines
Fraud Detection
Predictive maintenance.
```

#### Types of Machine Learning :
* Supervised Learning : Uses Labeled input and output the data.
* Unsupervised Learning : used to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets.
* Semi-supervised Learning


##### Linear Regression :
Linear Regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable.
Variable to be predicted is Dependent Variable.
Variable which is used to predict the value is Independent Variable


##### Multiple Linear Regression :
Multiple Regression is a technique that uses values of multiple independent variables and predicting the value of one dependent variable.


###### Pickle file:
It is a useful python tool that allows to save the ML Models and used to re-lod pre-trained machine learning models in future.
Reusability of file.

###### One Hot Encoding:
Technique applied to the integer representation and used to represent categorical variables
